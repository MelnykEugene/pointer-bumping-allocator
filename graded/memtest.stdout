x = 0x7fb6d039b008
y = 0x7fb6d039b028
z = 0x7fb6d039b044

testing whether a new block is allocated only when the size exceeds that of the old one:
x = 0x7fb6d039c074
reallocating x with SMALLER size
new allocation goes to 0x7fb6d039c074
reallocating x with LARGER size
new allocation goes to 0x7fb6d039c09c

testing whether the contents are copied correctly:
allocated 5 bytes for the string: abcd
reallocating 8 bytes
adding another two letter to the string...
result: abcdef
the original four letters were copied successfully

testing block alignment
allocating 5 bytes
aligned = true
allocating 17 bytes
aligned = true
allocating 4 bytes
aligned = true
allocating 1 byte
aligned = true
